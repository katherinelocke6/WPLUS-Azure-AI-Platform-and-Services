# Create Microsoft Foundry Project

## Introduction 

This lab will walk you through the steps to create a **Microsoft Foundry** resource using the **Azure Portal**. This is a required setup step before proceeding with lab exercises involving AI Foundry capabilities.

### 💡 What is Microsoft Foundry
Microsoft Foundry is a unified platform for building, deploying, and managing enterprise-grade AI applications and agents—combining powerful tools, models, and infrastructure with built-in governance and scalability.

## Objectives 
In this lab we will:
- Create Microsoft Foundry Resource and project	

## Estimated Time 

2- 10 minutes 

## Scenario
You are creating a Microsoft Foundry project that will be utilized later in the labs for several modules in this workshop.

## Pre-requisites
No pre-requisites

## 🛠️ Tasks

### 1. Sign in to Azure Portal

Go to +++https://portal.azure.com+++ and sign in with your Azure credentials. These credentials are present on the right hand side under resources tab below **Azure Portal**.

After you enter the password, Azure will prompt you for a **Temporary Access Pass (TAP)** as a mandatory second sign-in step -- this prompt cannot be skipped. The Resources tab that supplies your password also lists a separate Temporary Access Pass value; enter that value when prompted to complete sign-in.

### 4. Fill in the details and deploy

- [ ] Choose the Subscription if not filled in automatically
- [ ] In the **Resource group** field, select the existing resource group that is provided as part of this lab machine instance: **azureaiworkshoprg**
![Fill in Details](images/airg.png)  
- [ ] In the **Name** field, enter +++**ai-foundry-@lab.LabInstance.Id**+++ (eg ai-foundry-53439517).The screen shot provided here is just for reference, do not use the name provided in the screenshot below
- [ ] Choose a Region (e.g. East US 2)

> ⚠️ **Note:** Make sure the selected Azure region supports model GPT-5.1. You may check the **[Region availability for Foundry Models site](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/foundry-models/concepts/models-sold-directly-by-azure-region-availability?tabs=az-americas&pivots=standard#global-standard)**.

- [ ] In the **Default project name** field, delete the default value (if there is one) and enter +++**firstProject**+++. The lab environment will not let you use another name.

- [ ] Click **Next** button. Use this as a reference image for details but choose the existing resource group and fill in the rest of the details

![Fill in Details](images/fill_in_details_for_ai_foundry_resource.png)


- [ ] For this exercise, we will keep all default values for all the subsequent tabs (Storage, Inbound Networking, Outbound Networking). Review the values in each tab page and Click the **Next** button until you reach the **Review + create** tab.
- [ ] Click the **Create** button
- [ ] Deployment time varies; the deployment blade can remain "in progress" for 15 minutes or more even after the underlying resources are actually ready. Verify completion by checking the resource group's **Resources** list rather than waiting on the deployment blade alone.

### 5. Verify Deployment, and Go to Microsoft Foundry portal

- [ ] When your deployment is complete, click **Go to resource**

![Go to resource](images/aifoundrydeployed.png)
  
- [ ] Review the **Overview** details for the Microsoft Foundry resource you just created.
- [ ] Click **Go to Foundry Portal**
