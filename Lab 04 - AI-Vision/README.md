# Azure AI Vision – Lab

## Introduction

Azure AI Vision is a cloud-based service from Microsoft that uses advanced algorithms to analyze images and extract valuable information. It includes capabilities like face detection, Optical Character Recognition (OCR), image analysis, and video indexing.

> **Note:** The Azure Vision Studio portal now only displays the **Face** feature. OCR, Image Analysis, and Video Indexer capabilities are still accessible through their respective **SDKs and REST APIs**. This lab covers Face Analysis through the portal and provides SDK/API-based exercises for the other services via the accompanying notebook.

## Objectives

In this lab we will walk through:
- Face Analysis (via Vision Studio portal)
- OCR (via SDK/API)
- Image Analysis (via SDK/API)

## Estimated Time

30 minutes

## Scenario

Explore Azure AI Vision services: use the Vision Studio portal for Face Analysis, and the SDK/REST APIs for OCR, Image Analysis, and Video Indexer.

## Pre-requisites

Complete the pre-requisite instructions.

## Exercise 3: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) via SDK/API

> Warning: **Deprecation Notice:** The Image Analysis 4.0 OCR service is deprecated and will be **retired on September 25, 2028**. Legacy Computer Vision API versions (v1.0-v3.1) will be **retired on September 13, 2026**. Consider migrating to:
> - [Azure AI Document Intelligence - Read model](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/document-intelligence/prebuilt/read) (optimized for documents)
> - [Azure Content Understanding](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/content-understanding/overview) (managed generative solution)

While the OCR feature is no longer available in the Vision Studio portal, the **REST API and SDKs** remain fully functional until the retirement dates above.

The OCR API extracts printed and handwritten text from images such as posters, street signs, product labels, business documents, invoices, and receipts. It supports multiple languages and works with text on various surfaces and backgrounds.

### Set the Azure Computer Vision (Azure AI Vision) variables in the .ENV file

1. [ ] Go to +++https://portal.azure.com+++ 
1. [ ] In the top search bar, type **"Microsoft Foundry"**
1. [ ] Select **Microsoft Foundry** from the search results
    ![Search Microsoft Foundry](/Lab%2000%20-%20Prequisite%20-%20AI%20Foundry%20Resource%20Creation/images/search_ai_foundry.png)

> - [Azure Content Understanding](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/content-understanding/overview) (managed generative solution for images, documents, audio, and video)

While Image Analysis is no longer available in the Vision Studio portal, the **REST API and SDKs** remain fully functional until the retirement date above.

The Image Analysis API provides capabilities including:
- **Caption generation** - Generate natural language descriptions of images
- **Dense captions** - Detailed captions for multiple regions within an image
- **Tagging** - Extract common tags and objects detected in images
- **Smart cropping** - Intelligently crop images around areas of interest
- **Image retrieval** - Search photos using natural language queries

**Hands-on exercise:** Open the notebook at [`LabFiles/AI_vision_services_lab.ipynb`](./LabFiles/AI_vision_services_lab.ipynb) and complete the image-analysis sections that are currently included there: **Section 02 (Extract Text from Images / OCR)**, **Section 03 (Extract Tags from Images)**, **Section 04 (Add Dense Captions to Images)**, **Section 05 (Add Captions to Images)**, and **Section 06 (Create Smart-Cropped Images)**.

## Exercise 5: Video Indexer via API

Azure AI Video Indexer is a cloud-based service that extracts insights from videos using AI models for speech, vision, and natural language processing. The service is **actively supported** with no announced retirement date.

> **Note:** Azure Media Services (AMS)-based Video Indexer accounts were retired in June 2024. All new accounts are AMS-less. If migrating from an older account, see the [AMS migration guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-video-indexer/create-account).

The Video Indexer API enables you to:
- Upload and index videos programmatically
- Extract insights including people detection, topics, keywords, labels, named entities, and scenes
- Generate transcriptions, captions, and multi-modal video summaries
- Perform face redaction and object detection

**Hands-on exercise:** Open the notebook at [`LabFiles/AI_vision_services_lab.ipynb`](./LabFiles/AI_vision_services_lab.ipynb) and complete **Section 08 - Video Indexer** to upload and index a video via the API.
