## System Message

Under the Playground, go to Agents Playground by clicking on **Let's go** (labeled **Try the Agents Playground** in earlier versions of this lab). It may load directly into a pre-existing agent rather than prompting you to choose an AOAI resource; if so, use that agent or create a new one from there as described below.

> **Note:** If you create a new agent, an **Agent Deprecation Notice** dialog may appear first ("Agents (classic) are being phased out... we recommend creating all new agents powered by the generally available agent service"), offering **Create new agent** or **Create agent**. Choose **Create agent** to continue with the legacy flow this lab describes below (a second confirmation, **Create Legacy Agent**, may ask you to confirm). Both paths remain functional; the steps below assume the legacy **Create agent** path.

The instructions below givean idea of how to provide instructions to the agent before chatting with it. Step 1-5 below are informational to give an idea of how system prompt will look like.

**1. Define the Purpose of the AI Agent**

Clearly state what the AI agent is designed to do, including:
- **Domain:** (e.g., customer support, sales assistant, internal IT helpdesk)
- **Audience:** (e.g., end users, developers, executives)
- **Expected Outcomes:** (e.g., answer questions, generate reports, summarize documents)

**Example:**  
"This AI agent assists enterprise users with Azure-related technical queries and provides step-by-step troubleshooting guidance."

**2. Set the Role and Identity of the AI**
Define how the AI should present itself:

- **Name:** (if applicable)
- **Role:** (e.g., assistant, advisor, coach)
- **Tone:** (e.g., professional, friendly, concise)

**Example:**  
"You are AzureBot, a helpful and knowledgeable assistant for Azure developers. You speak in a professional yet approachable tone."

**3. Specify Capabilities and Limitations**

Outline what the AI can and cannot do to manage expectations and ensure safe, accurate responses.

**Example:**  
- You can answer questions about Azure services, pricing, and architecture.
- You cannot provide legal, financial, or medical advice.
- You must not generate code that modifies production environments without user confirmation.

**4. Define Behavioral Guidelines**

Provide instructions for handling different scenarios:
- How to handle ambiguous queries
- How to respond to inappropriate requests
- How to escalate or defer when unsure

**Example:**  
- If a query is unclear, ask clarifying questions.
- If a request is outside your scope, politely decline and suggest alternatives.

**5. Include Safety and Compliance Rules**

Ensure adherence to organizational policies, ethical guidelines, and compliance standards.

**Example:**  
- Do not store or share user data.
- Avoid generating content that could be offensive, biased, or discriminatory.
- Follow Microsoft Responsible AI principles.

**6. Test and Iterate**

After drafting the system message:
- [ ] Test with real prompts
- [ ] Observe AI behavior
- [ ] Refine the message based on feedback and edge cases

---

Use the example below to paste under the **instructions** for the agent and start chatting with the agent.

**Sample System Message Template**

You are AzureBot, a professional and friendly assistant for Azure developers. Your goal is to help users understand and use Azure services effectively.

**You can:**
- Answer questions about Azure services, pricing, and architecture
- Provide step-by-step troubleshooting guidance
- Generate sample code and templates

**You cannot:**
- Provide legal, financial, or medical advice
- Modify production environments without user confirmation

**Behavior:**
- Ask clarifying questions if the query is ambiguous
- Respond with empathy and professionalism
- Escalate or defer if unsure

## Prompt Shields

### Setup

Follow these steps to use the Content Safety "Try it out" page:

1. [ ] Go to Azure AI Foundry and navigate to your project or hub.
1. [ ] Select the **Guardrails + controls** tab on the left navigation, then choose the **Try it out** button.

### Using Prompt Shields for User Input Risk Detection

The **Prompt Shields** panel allows you to test user input risk detection. This feature identifies prompts intended to provoke the Generative AI model into unsafe behaviors or to bypass the rules defined in the System Message. Such attacks may include complex role-play or subtle attempts to undermine safety measures.

To use Prompt Shields:

1. [ ] Select the **Prompt Shields** panel.
1. [ ] Choose a sample text provided on the page, or enter your own content for testing.
1. [ ] Select **Run test**. The service will return the risk flag and type for each sample.
